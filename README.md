Hi, Kobe ! First of all, thank you, guys, for letting me show you my work. I was quite fun building this project. Since i already work full time, i only had 2 night to do this app ( i worked about 8 hours on this ). I did everything, i mean 'everything'. I built the logo, the 'poster not found' images,  the UI/UX. On the screensshots folder i will add my figma prototypes. I did everything i could with the time that i had. Thank you, again. Lets keep in touch =)
